# Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Detecting credit card fraud using supervised machine learning algorithms**

This notebook tries out several classification techniques, including:
* KNN
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* XGBoost Classifier 

In order to classify a dataset of transactions as either fraudulent or real. The dataset used in training the model is a synthetic dataset that has generated a more balanced number of fraudulent and real transactions, as the original dataset only has 492 fraudulent transactions out of over 200k+ total transaction records.
